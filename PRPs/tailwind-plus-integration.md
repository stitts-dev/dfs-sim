# Tailwind Plus Integration PRP v2

## Goal
Replace custom UI components with production-tested Catalyst UI Kit components and leverage Tailwind Plus UI Block templates to accelerate development, improve accessibility, and establish design consistency across the DFS Optimizer frontend.

## Why
- **Accelerated Development**: Leverage 500+ production-ready components instead of building from scratch
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Catalyst components include ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
- **Design Consistency**: Professional design patterns from the Tailwind team
- **Reduced Maintenance**: Vendor-maintained components reduce custom UI bugs and technical debt
- **Developer Experience**: Comprehensive TypeScript support and documented patterns

## What
Transform the existing DFS Optimizer frontend by systematically replacing custom components with Catalyst equivalents while preserving all existing functionality, dark mode support, and the beginner mode features.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All major UI components use Catalyst UI Kit primitives
- [ ] Complex layouts leverage Tailwind Plus UI Block templates  
- [ ] Dark mode and beginner mode functionality preserved
- [ ] Accessibility improvements measurable via lighthouse scores
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
- [ ] Component library usage documented for team

## All Needed Context

```

### Known Gotchas & Library Quirks
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Catalyst requires specific Link component integration
// Our project uses React Router, but Catalyst expects Link to handle 'href' prop
// Solution: Modify catalyst-ui-kit/typescript/link.tsx to use react-router-dom

// CRITICAL: Preserve existing CSS variable system
// Current: Uses HSL color variables like 'hsl(var(--primary))'
// Catalyst: Uses Tailwind's default theme
// Solution: Map existing variables to Catalyst's color system

// CRITICAL: BeginnerMode features must be preserved
// Current: Custom ring-2 ring-blue-400 classes for highlighting
// Solution: Extend Catalyst components with data-beginner-mode attributes

// GOTCHA: Dark mode implementation
// Current: Uses 'dark:' prefixes extensively  
// Catalyst: Built-in dark mode support
// Solution: Test all components in both modes, verify CSS variable compatibility

// PERFORMANCE: Import optimization
// Bad: import { Button } from '../catalyst-ui-kit'
// Good: import { Button } from '../catalyst-ui-kit/typescript/button'
// Why: Avoid importing entire component library bundle
```

## Implementation Blueprint

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
```yaml
Task 1 - Fix Catalyst Link Integration:
MODIFY src/catalyst-ui-kit/typescript/link.tsx:
  - FIND: Link component export
  - REPLACE: href prop handling with react-router-dom Link
  - PRESERVE: All existing Catalyst styling and behavior
  - TEST: Navigation still works throughout app

Task 2 - Create Catalyst Configuration:
CREATE src/lib/catalyst.ts:
  - EXPORT: Catalyst component overrides and defaults
  - INCLUDE: Project-specific color mappings
  - PROVIDE: Helper functions for beginnerMode integration
  
Task 3 - Set Up Testing Foundation:
INSTALL: @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom vitest jsdom
MODIFY: vite.config.ts to include test configuration
CREATE: tests/setup.ts for test utilities
```

### Phase 2: Core Component Migration
```yaml
Task 4 - Replace Button Components:

  - PRESERVE: Navigation state, keyboard shortcuts (F1), settings integration
  - ENHANCE: Responsive behavior and mobile navigation
```

### Phase 3: Complex Layout Templates
```yaml
Task 7 - Dashboard Stats Integration:

  - ENHANCE: Column resizing, better mobile table behavior
```

### Integration Points
```yaml
STYLES:
  - preserve: All CSS variables in index.css and tailwind.config.js
  - map: Existing color variables to Catalyst color props
  - extend: Tailwind config to include Catalyst customizations

STATE:
  - preserve: All Zustand stores and React Query configurations
  - enhance: Add UI state for Catalyst component behaviors (open/closed states)
  
ROUTING:
  - modify: Link component in catalyst-ui-kit to use react-router-dom
  - preserve: All existing route definitions and navigation logic

ACCESSIBILITY:
  - enhance: Leverage Catalyst's built-in ARIA attributes
  - preserve: Existing keyboard shortcuts and beginner mode features
  - test: Screen reader compatibility for all migrated components
```

## Validation Loop

### Level 1: Component Integration
```bash
# Verify Catalyst components import and render correctly
npm run dev
# Navigate to each page, verify no console errors
# Check: Dark mode toggle works, beginnerMode features preserved

# Expected: All pages load without React errors
# If errors: Check import paths, verify component props match Catalyst API
```

### Level 2: Visual Regression Testing  
```bash
# Compare before/after screenshots of each page
# Test both light and dark modes
# Test beginner mode enabled/disabled states

# Manual checklist:
# - [ ] Layout structure preserved
# - [ ] Colors and theming consistent
# - [ ] Interactive elements (buttons, modals) function correctly
# - [ ] Mobile responsive behavior improved or unchanged
```

### Level 3: Accessibility Testing
```bash
# Install lighthouse CI for automated accessibility testing
npm install -g @lhci/cli

# Run accessibility audits
lhci autorun --collect.url="http://localhost:5173/dashboard"
lhci autorun --collect.url="http://localhost:5173/optimizer"
lhci autorun --collect.url="http://localhost:5173/lineups"

# Expected: Accessibility scores >= 95 (improvement from current)
# If failing: Review Catalyst component usage, ensure proper ARIA attributes
```

### Level 4: Integration Testing
```bash
# Test complete user workflows
npm run lint        # Should pass with no errors
npm run type-check  # Should pass with no TypeScript errors
npm run build       # Should build successfully

# Manual workflow tests:
# 1. Dashboard → Contest selection → Optimizer
# 2. Settings modal → Preference changes → UI updates
# 3. Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape) throughout app
# 4. Dark mode toggle preserves user preferences
```

## Final Validation Checklist
- [ ] All Catalyst components render correctly in light/dark modes
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality (sport filtering, contest selection, preferences)
- [ ] Beginner mode features preserved and enhanced with Catalyst styling
- [ ] Accessibility scores improved across all pages
- [ ] Build size impact acceptable (< 50KB increase)
- [ ] Development team can easily customize and extend Catalyst components
- [ ] Component usage patterns documented in project README

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Don't customize Catalyst components beyond their intended API (breaks updates)
- ❌ Don't ignore dark mode testing - verify every component in both themes
- ❌ Don't replace working accessibility features - preserve keyboard shortcuts and screen reader support
- ❌ Don't import entire catalyst-ui-kit bundle - use specific component imports
- ❌ Don't break existing state management - preserve Zustand stores and React Query patterns
- ❌ Don't remove beginner mode features - these are core to user experience

## Confidence Score: 9/10
High confidence due to:
- Catalyst UI Kit already vendorized and ready to use
- Clear component mapping from custom → Catalyst equivalents
- Existing TypeScript setup supports Catalyst patterns
- All required dependencies already installed
- Comprehensive validation strategy covers visual, functional, and accessibility concerns

Risk mitigation:
- Phase-by-phase implementation allows for incremental validation
- Existing patterns preserved during migration
- Rollback possible by reverting to custom components if needed
